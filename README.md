This project was built following the intro to Material-UI tutorial at [Reactgo.com](https://reactgo.com/material-ui-react-tutorial/), but I cannot recommend others to try that tutorial since it is incomplete, outdated, and missing explanations for some key steps. It did get me started with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), so I guess there's that, and it also taught me to be sure to read through a tutorial before starting it. I'm looking for a more thorough Material-UI tutorial/course to continue building my expertise.
